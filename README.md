# Country Level Life Expectancy Model
The following outlines the relevant documentation for the Structural Equation Model (SEM) developed as part of a project for the class [STAT 360: Computational Statistics & Data Analysis](https://www.stthomas.edu/catalog/current/dsci/) instructed by [Dr. Sergey Berg](https://cas.stthomas.edu/departments/faculty/sergey-berg/) at the [University of St. Thomas](https://www.stthomas.edu/) in St. Paul, MN.

### Abstract
The [abstract](https://github.com/matt-lao/country-level-life-expectancy-model/blob/main/Abstract.pdf) overviews the research, methods, and findings that are relevant to the Country Level Life Expectancy SEM.

### Repository Guide
There are three folders in this repositiory, containing different file formats of the same four documents relevant to this project:
- A folder of [PDF versions](https://github.com/matt-lao/country-level-life-expectancy-model/tree/main/pdf-documents) - these can be viewed within GitHub directly
- A folder of [HTML versions](https://github.com/matt-lao/country-level-life-expectancy-model/tree/main/html-documents) - these can be downloaded and then viewed in the web browser
- A folder of [R Markdown versions](https://github.com/matt-lao/country-level-life-expectancy-model/tree/main/r-markdown-files) - these are the raw R Markdown files containing the code and research findings that were knitted together to make the above documents

The four documents in each folder overview the more detailed research, methods, and findings for our Country Level Life Exectancy SEM.
- DAT - A document overviewing our data matrix used in the SEM
- EDA - A document overviewing the Exploratory Data Analysis involved in creating the SEM
- EFA - A document overviewing the Exploratory Factor Analysis involved in creating the SEM
- SEM - A document overviewing the creationg of the Structural Equation Model
